Market Flipper Agent - Hackathon Submission
```

### Email Body:

```
Hi LiquidMetal Team,

I'm submitting my Market Flipper Agent for the hackathon.

**Project Name:** Market Flipper Agent
**Developer:** Gil Eskayo

**Quick Summary:**
An autonomous marketplace arbitrage agent built on Raindrop MCP that demonstrates:
- Multi-service architecture (3 services + 3 actors)
- Advanced valuation using 4 heuristic algorithms
- Smart decision-making with budget management
- SmartBuckets for AI-powered data storage
- Full test coverage (211 tests passing)

**Live Demo:**
- API URL: https://svc-01k6k5fjyd9amzg26kz7n3hyrk.01k507j1ctjqm9r2t725jq93x1.lmapp.run
- Test UI: See attached test-ui.html (open in browser for visual demo)
- Full Documentation: See attached HACKATHON_SUBMISSION.md

**Important Note:**
This demo uses simulated marketplace data to showcase the architecture and business logic.
The complete technical implementation is production-ready and can be connected to real
marketplace APIs (eBay API, etc.) with API keys.

**Quick Test Commands:**
# Check status
curl https://svc-01k6k5fjyd9amzg26kz7n3hyrk.01k507j1ctjqm9r2t725jq93x1.lmapp.run/status

# Run marketplace scan
curl -X POST https://svc-01k6k5fjyd9amzg26kz7n3hyrk.01k507j1ctjqm9r2t725jq93x1.lmapp.run/scan \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"maxPerMarketplace": 5, "category": "electronics"}'

**Raindrop MCP Features Showcased:**
âœ… Service-to-service communication (private services)
âœ… Stateful actors with persistent storage
âœ… SmartBuckets for intelligent data storage
âœ… Type-safe environment bindings
âœ… Full MVC architecture pattern
âœ… Comprehensive testing with TDD approach

Thank you for reviewing my submission!

Best regards,
Gil Eskayo

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Talking Points

**What Works (Real Implementation):**
1. Complete Raindrop MCP architecture
2. Valuation algorithms (4 heuristics)
3. Decision-making engine
4. Budget management
5. Inventory & transaction tracking
6. Full REST API
7. 211 passing tests

**What's Demo:**
1. Marketplace data is simulated
2. URLs are generated (not real listings)

**Why This Matters for Hackathon:**
- Proves architecture works
- Demonstrates Raindrop MCP mastery
- Shows production-ready code quality
- Ready to integrate real APIs

## ðŸ“§ Files to Attach

Located in: `/Users/gileskayo/autonomous-flipper/market-flipper-agent/`

1. `HACKATHON_SUBMISSION.md` - Main documentation
2. `test-ui.html` - Visual test interface

## ðŸš€ Next Steps After Submission

If they want you to add real data later, you'll need:
1. eBay API credentials (free tier available)
2. Update scraper-service/controller.ts to call real APIs
3. Add rate limiting and error handling for external APIs
4. Update tests to handle real API responses

**You can always come back to add real APIs later!**
